## This project is a responsive Sign-Up Form with built-in form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form captures user information such as First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number, and Password, and applies the following validations:

First Name and Last Name: Required fields.
Email: Must follow a valid email format.
Phone Number: Must be exactly 10 digits.
Password: Must be at least 8 characters long.
The form features a modern, mobile-friendly layout designed using Flexbox for alignment and includes error handling for incorrect inputs. On form submission, the data is validated and, if successful, logged as an object in the console, while displaying relevant error messages for invalid fields. The form uses vanilla JavaScript for validation and input handling, ensuring that no external libraries are required.
